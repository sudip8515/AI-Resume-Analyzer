                        Job Description: ${jobDescription}

                        the response should be a JSON object with a single field "html" which contains the HTML content of the resume which can be converted to PDF using any library like puppeteer.
                        The resume should be tailored for the given job description and should highlight the candidate's strengths and relevant experience. The HTML content should be well-formatted and structured, making it easy to read and visually appealing.
                        The content of resume should be not sound like it's generated by AI and should be as close as possible to a real human-written resume.
                        you can highlight the content using some colors or different font styles but the overall design should be simple and professional.
                        The content should be ATS friendly, i.e. it should be easily parsable by ATS systems without losing important information.
                        The resume should not be so lengthy, it should ideally be 1-2 pages long when converted to PDF. Focus on quality rather than quantity and make sure to include all the relevant information that can increase the candidate's chances of getting an interview call for the given job description.
                        IMPORTANT LAYOUT AND SPACING REQUIREMENTS:
                        - Keep the resume layout compact and space-efficient.
                        - Do NOT leave large or unnecessary vertical gaps between sections.
                        - Sections must appear immediately after the previous section with consistent spacing.
                        - Use small margins and padding between sections (approximately 8-15px).
                        - Keep paragraph margins minimal (approximately 2-5px).
                        - Use a compact line-height (approximately 1.2-1.4).
                        - Do NOT use excessive margin-top, margin-bottom, padding, min-height, or fixed-height values.
                        - Do NOT vertically distribute sections across the page.
                        - Do NOT use CSS such as justify-content: space-between for the main resume layout.
                        - Allow content to flow naturally from top to bottom.
                        - Avoid unnecessary page breaks between resume sections.
                        - Keep related sections close together, especially Education, Certifications, Projects, and Experience.
                        - The available page space should be used efficiently while maintaining readability.
